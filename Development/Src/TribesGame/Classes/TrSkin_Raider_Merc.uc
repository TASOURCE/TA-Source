   InfoPanelDescription="Some bands of warriors become mercenaries, selling their skills for payment. They are not fully trusted by tribesmen, though more for reasons of prudence. At the end of a contract period, mercenary groups may go to work for an enemy. During a contract, mercenaries are considered as reliable on the field as any tribesman. Treacherous merc groups are cast out and hunted down like dogs."
